## DevSecOps ? why ?

Recently one of my friend and I were discussing our roles, research and new technologies in the Security industry. Here is the conversation. . .

Friend: Hey ! What are you up to these days?
Me: We are implementing DevSecOps solutions for our customers.
Friend: That’s cool ! What exactly do you do in DevSecOps?
Me: We help organization build secure software using DevOps.
Friend: Yeah..but WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DO?
Naming Confusion

First of all Lets discuss a few definition that are floating around DevSecOps or lets just say security in DevOps. Those terms are

DevSecOps, SecDevOps, DevOpsSec, Rugged DevOps these are a few that are used interchangeably while discussing security in DevOps(until someone comes with a new fancy name).

Some say DevSecOps is shifting security to the left. Some may agree with following definition; The purpose and intent of DevSecOps is to build on the mindset that “everyone is responsible for security”. Others may say DevSecOps is nothing but Integrating Security tools into DevOps. Some may say that it is the process of securing DevOps pipelines.

Well, main motive or outcome behind all these terms is to“Build software with more security and pace”. Its this simple, without fancy terms this is the plain simple definition but this does not necessarily speak about imeplementationg DevSecOps or gives insight. This is where all confusion starts. While building a software it goes without saying security must be considered for both the software being built and the ones that are used in the process.

Which means Security is an integral part of DevOps. People have been implementing Security as part of DevOps pipelines long before these fancy words were invented. They did not consider security as a separate thing that should be shoved into DevOps and label it as DevSecOps, they implemented security considering its an integral part of DevOps. New terminologies were used to distinguish the ones which less concern about security.

## What is DevSecOps?

What exactly is DevSecOps?

I see many terminologies that are used in context of “Security in DevOps”, those are DevSecOps, DevOpsSec, SecDevOps, Rugged DevOps! Well here is what I think of DevSecOps.

“An approach to build a secure software with pace and an ecosystem built on automation.”

No technical jargon ? C’mon you must have missed something. Unfortunately this is current state of industry looking forward to jump the hype train. Whenever DevSecOps is being discussed everybody starts talking about CICD, SAST, DAST, IAST,OAST, RASP and many more security jargon that most of the developers and IT guys don’t even understand. Why DevSecOps has became a tool thingy and less Process Oriented, Security policy driven framework which solves the problems and does not complicate things.

Ideally Security is an integral part of DevOps but due to lack of security knowledge devops teams struggle to implement DevSecOps. Even after training DevOps guys to use a lot of security tools, organizations are still facing problems incorporating security into pipeline or as I say not able to reduce the overall risk by implementing security ecosystems?
